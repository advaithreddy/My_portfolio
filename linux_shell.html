            <ul>
                <li>Introduction to Operating Systems</li>
                <li>Linux kernal</li>

            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>The Linux Shell Operating System project is a command-line based operating system that provides a lightweight 
                and efficient environment for users to interact with the underlying Linux kernel. Built around the concept of 
                a shell, it allows users to execute commands, manage files, run programs, and perform various tasks efficiently 
                through the terminal interface.</p><hr>
                <p>This project is a modification of the original work by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karmanjyot-singh/" target="_blank">Karmanjyot Singh</a>, which focused on karma-Shell OS based on Linux kernal.
                    I thoroughly studied and analyzed his implementation and made specific 
                    enhancements to tailor it for my Understanding skills of OS and Linux kernal.</p>
            <summary>Contributions</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>Reviewed and understood the existing codebase to grasp the project's architecture and functionality.</li>
                <li>Identified areas of improvement and optimization, resulting in:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Command Execution Optimization</strong>
                        Refined the command execution process to reduce system call overhead and improve the overall responsiveness of the shell. 
                        This optimization led to faster command execution, enhancing user productivity.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Kernal-specific system commands</strong>
                        Added kernel-specific system commands to provide users with direct access to kernel features and statistics, 
                        offering deeper insights into system performance and behavior.
                    </li>

            <summary>Credit</summary>
            <p>I express my gratitude to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karmanjyot-singh/" target="_blank">Karmanjyot Singh</a> for their pioneering work on the "karma-shell" project.
                My contributions to this modified version build upon the original groundwork, and I acknowledge 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karmanjyot-singh/" target="_blank">Karmanjyot Singh</a> for their significant contributions to this project.</p>
            <summary>Execution Instructions</summary>
            <ul>
                <li> run `make` to create an executable `shell`</li>
                <li> run command `./shell` in the terminal , and there the shell runs.</li>
            </ul>
            <summary>Introduction</summary>
            <p>This is Linux - C Shell </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To exit the Shell</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Press <kbd>Ctrl + D</kbd> , saves the current session history , and exits the terminal </li>
                    <li>enter `exit` command in terminal.</li>
                    <li><summary>Assumptions</summary>
                        <ol>
                            <li>note that : `max_length` of command names are assumed to be of max-length `name_len` defined in `header.h` as `1024`</li>
                            <li>`history` command displays the `10` last commands entered , with latest command on the top.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </ul>

            <summary>Shell Features</summary>
            <ol>
                <li>The shell supports the following commands being implemented by me : `bg` , `baywatch` , `cd` , `echo` , `fg` , `history` , `jobs` , `ls` , `pinfo` , `pwd` , `replay` , `repeat` , `sig` , and other external `shell commands` .</li>
                <li>It with support for `redirection` operations [ `>` , `<` , `>>` ] and `piping` [ `|` ] .</li>
                <li>Error Handling</li>
                <li>Signal Handling for signals like `SIGINT` , `SIGTSTP` , `SIGCHLD` and external keyboard interrupts like <kbd>Ctrl +C</kbd> , <kbd>Ctrl + Z</kbd>.</li>
                <li> Running processes in `foreground` & `background` environments along with </li>
                <li>Command `history` implemented, storing the latest commands , that remains saved across shell-sessions.</li>
                <li>Multiple commands separated by `;` handled, However there's no support for handling `"` or `'` ( quotes ).</li>
            </ol>
