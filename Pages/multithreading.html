            <p>The Multithreading Simulations project is a C-based endeavor that explores the world of concurrent programming and multithreading using pthreads (POSIX threads) library. The project aims to simulate and analyze various scenarios where multithreading plays a crucial role in achieving parallelism and improving overall performance. Leveraging the power of pthreads, this project demonstrates efficient resource utilization and synchronization mechanisms in a multithreaded environment.</p>
