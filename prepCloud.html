<summary>Description</summary>

<p>PrepCloud is a comprehensive cloud storage platform designed to provide users with secure and efficient data storage and management capabilities. 
    It combines a robust backend system with a user-friendly frontend interface to offer a seamless experience for individuals and organizations looking 
    to store and manage their digital assets in the cloud.</p>

<summary>Introduction</summary>

<p>In today's digital age, the need for reliable and secure cloud storage solutions is paramount. Whether it's personal documents, business files, or 
    multimedia content, PrepCloud offers a safe and convenient space for users to store and access their data from anywhere, at any time. </p>

<summary>Key Features</summary>
<ul>
    <li><b>User Authentication</b> Users can sign up and sign in securely, with their credentials being validated on the backend. Passwords are hashed and stored securely.</li>
    <li><b>Data Storage</b> PrepCloud allows users to upload and store various types of files, ensuring that data remains intact and easily accessible.</li>
    <li><b>User-Friendly Interface</b> The frontend interface is designed with a focus on user experience, making it simple for users to navigate, upload, and manage their files.</li>
    <li><b>Validation</b> Robust validation mechanisms are in place for user inputs, including name, email, and password, ensuring data integrity.</li>
    <li><b>Token-Based Authentication</b> User sessions are managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to provide secure and efficient communication between the frontend and backend.</li>
    <li><b>Data Encryption</b> Data is encrypted to safeguard user privacy and confidentiality, ensuring that even in transit, data remains secure.</li>
    <li><b>Error Handling</b> Comprehensive error handling is implemented to provide informative and user-friendly error messages in case of issues.</li>
</ul>

<summary>Technologies Used:</summary>
<ul>
    <li><b>Backend</b> Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (for data storage), JWT for user authentication, and bcrypt for password hashing.</li>
    <li><b>Frontend</b> Vue.js for building the user interface.</li>
</ul>

<summary>How to Use</summary>
<ol>
    <li><b>Sign Up:</b> Users can create an account by providing their name, email, and password. The system validates the input and securely stores user data in the database.</li>
    <li><b>Sign In:</b> Once registered, users can sign in using their credentials. The system verifies the user's identity, generates a JWT token, and sends it to the frontend for secure communication.</li>
    <li><b>Upload Files:</b> Users can upload files of various types, such as documents, images, and videos, to their cloud storage.</li>
    <li><b>Manage Files:</b> The frontend provides features for users to view, organize, and manage their uploaded files.</li>
</ol>


<summary>Security</summary>
<ul>
    <li>User passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database, preventing unauthorized access.</li>
    <li>JWT tokens are used for secure communication, preventing data interception by malicious parties.</li>
    <li>Data encryption ensures user files remain confidential.</li>
</ul>
